    <div class="half lyrics bodr"><h1><span class="orenge">"Stay Beautiful"</span></h1>
        <p >
            Cory's eyes are like a. 
        He smiles, it's like the radio.
        He whispers songs into my window.
        In words that nobody knows.
        There's pretty girls on every corner.
        That watch him as he's walking home
        Saying, "Does he know?"
        Will you ever know?
        </p>

    <div class="half lyrics bodr">
        <h1> <span class="orenge">"The Way I Loved You"</span> </h1>
        <p>He is sensible and so incredible
            And all my single friends are jealous.
            He says everything I need to hear and it's like,
            I couldn't ask for anything better.
            He opens up my door and I get into his car
            And he says you look beautiful tonight
            And I feel perfectly fine</p>
